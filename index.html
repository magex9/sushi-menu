      <h2>Business Case</h2>
	  <p>As we were sitting at our local all you can eat sushi restaurant trying to figure out what we wanted to order next, we saw names like "black dragon", "red dragon", "crispy roll" we wondered what they could be.  We have our phones out and looking up the info and wondered why we couldn't just use our phones to put orders to our table and see what we are still waiting for, what's popular, etc.  The restaurant could even have tablets at every table that could replace menu's for people who dont have their own mobile devices.  This could let customers view detailed descriptions, ingredients, pictures, comments and maybe even save their favorite.</p>
	  <p>The sushi menu is an idea for an example application with a complete lifecycle from business case, user stories, system design, prototyping, implementation, and handling some change requests.  The design and architecture are the important parts of this project not the final resulting application.  The idea is to walk through a project from conception to implementation of an application that many user interfaces could be plugged into, and have many different back ends that could implement the requirements.</p>
	  <h2>User Stories</h2>
	  <p>A user story is a description consisting of one or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function.  The following are high level descriptions of what the system is requested to do.  Each user story will be broken down into multiple use cases whic may be shared among user stories which describe what the system must do.</p>
	  <h3>Authentication</h3>
	  <p>Customers must be able to login to the application from any device with their email and a password.</p>
	  <p>Anyone can sign up and they must be able to retireve lost usernames and passwords</p>
